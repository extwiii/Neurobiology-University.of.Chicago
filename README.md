Understanding the Brain: The Neurobiology of Everyday Life - Coursera

## The Nervous System
* [Here](https://youtu.be/cGv3Jj37jJc) a woman tells her story of being diagnosed with a brain tumor
* A great introductory resource is provided by the [Society for Neuroscience](http://www.sfn.org/), called [BrainFacts](http://www.brainfacts.org/).
## Neural Communication + Embodied Emotion
* Learn more about how [voltage, current, and resistance](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-current-resistance-and-ohms-law/all) are much like the flow of water.
* Watch an informational video on the cell membrane, which also has a great discussion on why molecules move by diffusion:[link](http://www.youtube.com/embed/moPJkCbKjBs)
## Neuroanatomy
* A video about a man with spinal cord injury, and the ongoing research to aid recovery:[link](http://www.brainfacts.org/Diseases-Disorders/Injury/Articles/2005/Searching-for-Answers-Spinal-Cord-Injury)
## Perception and Vision
* [Here](https://youtu.be/_1oYdE-usfI), Professor Mason interviews a woman with Albinism
* [Here](https://youtu.be/bz7hj_YC3j0) are some more incredible illusions that show how our perceptions do not always tell the truth about sensory stimuli
* [The image](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/iCJpYYGXEeaQkhKk4jYr6Q_1096f6a51bcda9b174edc6e1650c4592_IDo0lDH.gif?expiry=1492128000000&hmac=pdJfiY25X9dmevFiuZCci1DJNXbQ6isbTtpl6mjtGS0) is an example of an optical illusion. Can you explain what is happening that causes it?
* Learn more [here](https://youtu.be/yQ4rDNOX7So) about myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism
* Watch as a patient narrates his own Lasik surgery. Warning, [this video](https://youtu.be/TBfAuvOPjeg) shows actual Lasik surgery, and may not be suitable for all students
## Hearing
* Tom Rice, who received a cochlear implant in October of 2013, shares his nearly [life-long experience](https://youtu.be/ajMyYcBV8Os) with hearing loss
* An awesome [video](https://youtu.be/PeTriGTENoc) that traces the pathway of sound transmission
* A woman [hears herself for the first time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsOo3jzkhYA&feature=youtu.be) with the help of a cochlear implant. [She later was invited to the Ellen show and was gifted with a second implant, which costs $30,000!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp4usWroDew)
## The Vestibular Sense & Gaze
* [This video](https://youtu.be/dSHnGO9qGsE) is a very clear and accurate description of the anatomy and function of the vestibular apparatus
* [Here](https://youtu.be/eeCn7Pj4nZ4) is a quick and informative video on vertigo.
## Voluntary Movements
* Learn about all the [reflexes that can be tested by physicians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYOnWQHxJts).
## Motor Modulation
* [This video](https://youtu.be/zbwhRdSNUSY) nicely illustrates how the dendritic trees of Purkinje cells are in a single plane
* Learn more about Parkinson's Disease from one of its most famous sufferers, [Michael J. Fox](https://youtu.be/fGlmOaC5Jko)
## Homeostasis
* [Learn](https://youtu.be/NJEBfl_LKno) how animals regulate their body temperature in extremely hot and cold environments
* [What would happen if you stopped sleeping?](https://youtu.be/nNhDkKAvxFk)
## Abstract Function
* [Test your attention skills!](https://youtu.be/vJG698U2Mvo)
* A fascinating series of videos chronicles one young woman's experience with Broca's (expressive) aphasia following a stroke at 18.The first [video](https://youtu.be/1aplTvEQ6ew) takes place 9 months after a stroke. [The second](https://youtu.be/Zi1yQhYpfFM) is a full 5 years after her stroke.
